                    <p> Assignment 3 Translating Affordances, Oct 4 2021</p>
                    <p> Speaking of taking the inspiration to the interfaces of app, the first one that comes to my mind is those map apps. I am choosing the app Transit today because I think it has specific targets, strong affordances, and I cannot live without it in the New York City (I think anyone in NYC should have it). </p>
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/transit.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/rline.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/bline.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p>I start to explore what I can do to bring this interface to a physical present. The app simply shows the location shape, where the user is, and the time information for each train. Unlike Google Map, the Transit map only serve for the NYC Metro information. I analyze the affordances below:</p>
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/affordance.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/start.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p> Then I start to build my prototype. I mainly used cardboard to differentiate the layers of the interface. R and B line are chosen to present in the prototype. I think it will be fancy if the location of the user actually lights up. So I bring out the electronic kits to build up a simple circuit, and use a blue LED as the indicator of my current location.</p>

                    <p> My final result and the video demonstration:</p>
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/p4.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <video width="600" height="450" controls>
                        <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        {% comment %} <source src="video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
                        Your browser does not support the video tag. {% endcomment %}
                    </video>
                    <p> The video demonstrates how to interact with the prototype. Just like in the real app, the row of the train will shake a little bit when the train is approaching. If you tap on one specific line, then the “screen” will zoom in only showing that line. </p>
                    <p> The last assignment really opens my mind of how to create a prototype with the resource I have. I think the challenge part of this assignment is to analyze the affordances in the app and physically making them. I was hesitating at the beginning of what material I should use for showing the user location, because I think it is a very special and important affordance to alert the user. It ends up that LED is a good choice! I am excited to create more fun prototype in the future!</p>

                    <p> Assignmemnt 2 Endanger Animal, Sept 27, 2021</p>
                    <p> Sulawesi Cardinal Shrimp</p>
                    <p> The native of this shrimp is in Indonesia. In 2018, the IUCN RED LIST marked them as Critically Endangered and possibly extinct in the wild.  The current population trend is still decreasing. The shrimps live in the freshwater, which is inland waters. Caridina dennerli is available in the aquarium trade, most of them is wild caught even though the current levels of harvesting are not thought to have a considerable impact. They only have 1 year life length. Because of such short life, they become hard to multiply due to the following factors:
                        <br>1.	Lack of biological resources due to the fishing & harvesting aquatic resources
                        <br>2.	Dams and other water management break the natural system
                        <br>3.	Invasive and other problematic species, genes& diseases, the most critical one is Flowerhorn cichlids
                        <br>4.	Pollutions from industrial & military effluents, and agricultural effluents
                        </p>
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass2_Shrimp.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass2_largemap.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p> Among these 4 factors, the pollution is one of the most threaten to this species, as there are nickel mining and hydro-electric power installations that bring siltation to the lake. The rapid expanding of human population around the lake cause the erosion and organic effluents too. 
This species was considered abundant in 2009, but then a significant decline was observed in 2011, till 2017, there was no specimens were found at two sites where they had been abundant before. However, sadly, no conservation plans are currently in place for them. We need more research to confirm if they are still extant. If so, the protection of their localities and habitats is needed, along with controlling the invasive species and harvest management. 
I decided to use aluminum can (because it can stand for the industrial pollution and human bump population at the same time) to make the prototype of the shrimp, here are some process pictures:
