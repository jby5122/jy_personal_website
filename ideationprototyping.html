                    <p>Assignmemnt 4 50 Renderings, Oct 11 2021</p>
                    <p>To start this assignment, I am first thinking of which objects I should choose. I brainstorm a couple of examples such as books, fruits, then I realize these are too specific. In order to improve my skills of creative perception, interpretation and representation, I challenge myself to choose a “vaguer” object, so that I can interpret it to more metaphors. My thought process is in the below picture: Time? Love? Or even Magic? Within all these vague objects, I decide to do “Water”. Water can be any shape of the container. Water can be soft and gentle, but it can also be very powerful and making impact. Water is the transparent, but it is almost the main constituent of Earth’s hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organism. It is very important for all of us yet remain mystery of itself. It will be fun to find all the metaphors and to render them. </p>
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass4/thought1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p>Next step is sorting out the mediums I can use to render water. I divide them into the following categories: 2D graphic, 3D graphic, and the sound. Then I start rendering the water based on my image to it. </p>
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass4/thought2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p>First 10 of the renderings I choose Procreate on iPad to completed. The 1st one is three water drips of vector image I drew. The 2nd one is an abstract version of water, and I am inspired by the Tokyo Olympics’ pictograms. The 3rd one is animate version of the water bottle. The 4th one is peaceful ocean created by the “Oceans” in the Procreate brush library. The 5th one is a Japanese animate version of the tap water. The 6th one is also the “Water” pen in the Procreate brush library. For the 7th one, since the word “watermelon” has water inside, it will be interesting if I fill in water with watermelon. The 8th and 9th are the sketch of waterdrop with different brushes (6B pencil and airbrush). 10th is the splash of water. </p>

                    <p>Next, I use a tissue box with a pretty color to cut out 5 different language of the word “Water”. They are truly different compare to each other, but the text to the native speaker is the strongest metaphor for water, as this represents the water in that specific culture. </p>
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass4/p3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p>Then, minimalistic approach comes into my head. Besides pure color block, I also use yard, colored paper, sand and plastic bottle to represent the water. </p>
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass4/p4.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p>For the next group, I use photography to approach the realistic. To represent the flexibility of water, I choose different shapes of container. </p>
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass4/p5.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p>The name for the below group photography is called the “Present of the water”. Water is easy to flow in some of the materials and change the properties of that materials such as paper towel or tissue, but materials like wax paper or aluminum sheet are hard to get wet.</p>
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass4/p6.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p>I also collect a metaphor group for objects that are mostly, over 70% composted by water. They are Earth, jellyfish, coconut, human being, and cloud. </p>

                    <p>Last but not lease, I use sound as media to give people images of water. I gather 10 kinds of different sounds from both nature and artifact. Below are the audio:</p>

                    <p>Here are my 50 renderings of water. The process is fun yet hard in my opinion, but it definitely opens my imagination and push myself to develop more interested medium to express my thoughts. Thank you for viewing!</p>
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p> Assignment 3 Translating Affordances, Oct 4 2021</p>
                    <p> Speaking of taking the inspiration to the interfaces of app, the first one that comes to my mind is those map apps. I am choosing the app Transit today because I think it has specific targets, strong affordances, and I cannot live without it in the New York City (I think anyone in NYC should have it). </p>
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/transit.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/rline.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/bline.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p>I start to explore what I can do to bring this interface to a physical present. The app simply shows the location shape, where the user is, and the time information for each train. Unlike Google Map, the Transit map only serve for the NYC Metro information. I analyze the affordances below:</p>
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/affordance.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/start.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p> Then I start to build my prototype. I mainly used cardboard to differentiate the layers of the interface. R and B line are chosen to present in the prototype. I think it will be fancy if the location of the user actually lights up. So I bring out the electronic kits to build up a simple circuit, and use a blue LED as the indicator of my current location.</p>
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/p1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/p2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/p3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/led.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p> My final result and the video demonstration:</p>
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass3/p4.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <iframe width="600" height="450"
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GrbwHXsu2rs">
                    </iframe>
                    <p> The video demonstrates how to interact with the prototype. Just like in the real app, the row of the train will shake a little bit when the train is approaching. If you tap on one specific line, then the “screen” will zoom in only showing that line. </p>
                    <p> The last assignment really opens my mind of how to create a prototype with the resource I have. I think the challenge part of this assignment is to analyze the affordances in the app and physically making them. I was hesitating at the beginning of what material I should use for showing the user location, because I think it is a very special and important affordance to alert the user. It ends up that LED is a good choice! I am excited to create more fun prototype in the future!</p>
                <p>--------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p> Assignmemnt 2 Endanger Animal, Sept 27, 2021</p>
                    <p> Sulawesi Cardinal Shrimp</p>
                    <p> The native of this shrimp is in Indonesia. In 2018, the IUCN RED LIST marked them as Critically Endangered and possibly extinct in the wild.  The current population trend is still decreasing. The shrimps live in the freshwater, which is inland waters. Caridina dennerli is available in the aquarium trade, most of them is wild caught even though the current levels of harvesting are not thought to have a considerable impact. They only have 1 year life length. Because of such short life, they become hard to multiply due to the following factors:
                        <br>1.	Lack of biological resources due to the fishing & harvesting aquatic resources
                        <br>2.	Dams and other water management break the natural system
                        <br>3.	Invasive and other problematic species, genes& diseases, the most critical one is Flowerhorn cichlids
                        <br>4.	Pollutions from industrial & military effluents, and agricultural effluents
                        </p>
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass2_Shrimp.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <img src="ideation_prototyping/ass2_largemap.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p> Among these 4 factors, the pollution is one of the most threaten to this species, as there are nickel mining and hydro-electric power installations that bring siltation to the lake. The rapid expanding of human population around the lake cause the erosion and organic effluents too. 
This species was considered abundant in 2009, but then a significant decline was observed in 2011, till 2017, there was no specimens were found at two sites where they had been abundant before. However, sadly, no conservation plans are currently in place for them. We need more research to confirm if they are still extant. If so, the protection of their localities and habitats is needed, along with controlling the invasive species and harvest management. 
I decided to use aluminum can (because it can stand for the industrial pollution and human bump population at the same time) to make the prototype of the shrimp, here are some process pictures:
