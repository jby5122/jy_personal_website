                    <p> Week 3 reading, Sept 29, 2021</p>
                    <p> Alt breaks down the evolution of computer programming, from binary code to how language builds on each other to evolve to today’s stage where we can draw or build up interface. As I have been always wondering the value of digital art, I think this paper really walks me through the definition of computer as a medium and how we use it to create art.
<br>I have understood until I read the paper, that we can see computer as pencils and paper while we are creating digital art. One might argue that even a child can draw with pencil and paper, but not with computer. But I think it will be better to define a good art drawing first. One would need certain level of practice and skills to draw a masterpiece on paper, not just simple shapes like circle or rectangle. It is the same as coding. Before taking this class, I thought drawing with code would be easy, you just put different shape with different command. And kept asking myself why would those have any artistic value? Now until several my own practice and Alt’s work, I know that there is so much deeper than what I think. It only takes one class or object or function to spin your head around. 
<br>Not only the digital art, but computational programming also gave us the ability to interact with art and math. The Mathematical models now because the foundation of the art, in this saying, I feel like art now is more tangible that it is something we can interact with. I think the power of the computation that it is efficient in some ways, that after solving the math and coding problem, one will have the ability to replicate some part in the drawing with the way he/she wants very fast, saying using the class function, while it would be so time consuming on paper with pencil, on computer it might just be one click. Computer becomes the new medium, just like a good brush to a painter, can serve what the designers/developers the effect they needed.

                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p> Week 2 reading, Sept 22, 2021</p>
                    <p>For the first reading, I chose The Art of Interaction Design. I really like how Crawford metaphors interaction as conservation. Sometimes it is hard to recognize if you are interact with something or just reacting in nowadays high tech world. But thinking about conversation will draw a rather clear line of the conclusion to distinguish if you are interacting or not. The division of input, processing and the output makes interaction easier to understand and to build based on a clearer understanding as a designer. I like how he also have rank for reaction and interaction, as I sometimes also confused a high reaction as an interaction. The examples of book and movie clearly demonstrate the three keys of Interaction must be existed: listen, think and speak. I might feel like I am interacting with the author but that is just in the emotional level, not the real interaction. I also agree that the misconception on dividing design process into graphic design and interactivizing step. When I did my internship in the OnePlus Technology, and I believe many other big tech companies do so too, they have a clear division of UI group and the UX group. To me, they are like the Möbius strip, one is the foundation to the other, like he said “good interactivity design integrates form with function”. 


Interaction is so special that it exceed other forms of human expressions. It is the tool in the designers’s hand to make computer competing with the other industries. It is what brings computer to the revolutionary era. From 1970s till now, from the first computer to personal computer almost on everyone’s desk, the interaction between human and computer becomes more and more important as it is computer’s intrinsic competitive advantage. I am now more excited to explore this unknown territory to discover more new software and hardware technologies. </p>
                    
                    <p>--------------------------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>Week1 Sept 14, 2021</p>
                    <p>Since I was a kid, I always feel like there is division line between math and art. Especially in Asia countries, people who are good at math tended to be praised as “you are very logical!”, while people who are good at art will be praised as “you are very sentimental!”. Throughout the undergrads study, I have met people in engineering that can draw beautiful art, also people in art major that are really smart in math or engineering field. I did not realize the bias is still in my head until I read this article. I really how the article interprets the interactive art in a logical frame that combined the program, sensory inputs, and the memory. One sentence that really touches me is the “What often happens during this reductive and transformational process is that the subtlety in the work is lost simply because of the fact that things have to be defined with mathematical precision.” The common senses tend to divide math and art so clearly, that we almost forgot that to interactive art, experience cannot be excluded, which means human feeling and a non-feeling operating machine would need to be present at the same time in the progress, which means the division line could be very broad here. This brought me back to the in class exercise we had last week where we tried to redraw a famous painting in P5.js. It made me wonder that if the outcome of a digital drawing can also express emotion, or human feeling when the nature of it is actually sophisticated programed codes. Just like what Mr. Campbell demonstrated in the conclusion, that interactive art that uses a computer is still in its developmental stages, people like me who are new to this area might be confused or battling deep in the mind. But this article has successfully solves part of my tangle and I would like to try to build more to represent my thinking process in the present.
