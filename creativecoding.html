                    <p>Week1 Sept 14, 2021</p>
                    <p>Since I was a kid, I always feel like there is division line between math and art. Especially in Asia countries, people who are good at math tended to be praised as “you are very logical!”, while people who are good at art will be praised as “you are very sentimental!”. Throughout the undergrads study, I have met people in engineering that can draw beautiful art, also people in art major that are really smart in math or engineering field. I did not realize the bias is still in my head until I read this article. I really how the article interprets the interactive art in a logical frame that combined the program, sensory inputs, and the memory. One sentence that really touches me is the “What often happens during this reductive and transformational process is that the subtlety in the work is lost simply because of the fact that things have to be defined with mathematical precision.” The common senses tend to divide math and art so clearly, that we almost forgot that to interactive art, experience cannot be excluded, which means human feeling and a non-feeling operating machine would need to be present at the same time in the progress, which means the division line could be very broad here. This brought me back to the in class exercise we had last week where we tried to redraw a famous painting in P5.js. It made me wonder that if the outcome of a digital drawing can also express emotion, or human feeling when the nature of it is actually sophisticated programed codes. Just like what Mr. Campbell demonstrated in the conclusion, that interactive art that uses a computer is still in its developmental stages, people like me who are new to this area might be confused or battling deep in the mind. But this article has successfully solves part of my tangle and I would like to try to build more to represent my thinking process in the present.</p>
