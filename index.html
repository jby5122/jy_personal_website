        <p>change I am Jiyun Yao, you can also call me Dawn. I am an Engineer who is learning design but originally wanted to become a doctor. Yes, I guess you can tell I am an interdisciplinary engineer. I was born and raised in the seaside city, Shenzhen, China, and graduated from the Pennsylvania State University in 2020 with the degree in Industrial Engineering. Then I went to OnePlus interned in the system user experience team for a while. Now I am studying in Integrated Design & Media in New York University.

I enjoy the merge of design and engineering, and by that I want to create fancy but functional tools that can open doors for others, for all. Stresses definitely come up a lot during this progress, so I probably find some good restaurants, play some instruments, travel, bake, swim or watch Netflix in my cozy bed.
